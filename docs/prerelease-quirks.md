# Pre-release quirks

Behavior changes since the last stable release, newest first. This file is
reset at each stable release.

## 0.8.0a1

- Prototype mode caches each label's encoded prototypes to disk, keyed on
  the registration's inputs (model id, `model2vec` version,
  anchor-selection parameters, raw pre-expansion template lines, referenced
  entity values). A registration whose inputs are unchanged since the last
  boot loads its embeddings from the cache instead of re-encoding through
  the embedding model; any other input change is a plain cache miss.
  `detach_intent`/`detach_skill` (and their OVOS-INTENT-4 equivalents)
  delete the corresponding cache entry so a removed skill's intents are not
  resurrected from a stale cache on the next boot. Enabled by default
  (`prototype_cache: false` disables it); see the README's "Prototype
  cache" section for the on-disk layout and the `prototype_cache_dir`
  override.

## 0.7.0a1

- Classifier-mode label remapping is configurable instead of a hardcoded OCP
  / common-query / stop table: `label_map` (config) maps a raw model label to
  its canonical `skill_id:intent` label, merged over the built-in defaults
  and over any `labels.json` the loaded model ships alongside it (defaults <
  model manifest < user config). A trained model's frozen label head is model
  metadata, not plugin code, so the model itself is now the natural place to
  document what its labels mean.
- `valid_labels` (config) is the allow-list counterpart of `ignore_intents`:
  when set, only the listed canonical labels are eligible to match. Both
  filters apply after `label_map` resolution. With no `label_map` /
  `valid_labels` config and no `labels.json` on the model, behavior is
  unchanged.
- A `label_map` target that is not a `skill_id:intent` string (no colon) is
  logged as a warning (once per label) and used as-is; the plugin never
  invents a bus topic.
- `labels.json` lookup for a hub-id model never touches the network:
  construction only consults the local HF cache (`local_files_only=True`),
  riding whatever cache entry the model's own weights were already fetched
  into. A model not yet cached, or with no manifest, is silently treated as
  having none - the manifest is never a reason for pipeline construction to
  block on a network round trip.

## 0.6.1a1

- `PrototypeIntentStore` consolidation no longer needs a transient copy of
  the whole store: it pre-allocates the final-size array once and copies
  the existing store plus each pending chunk into it in turn, dropping
  every source as soon as it is copied, instead of `np.vstack`-ing the old
  array and every pending chunk at once (~2x peak over the final store
  size). A `MemoryError` while doing so is logged and the pending batch is
  left untouched rather than raised or silently dropped, so the store stays
  usable with whatever it already consolidated. On a real deployment this
  transient doubling, hit on the bus dispatch thread handling the first
  utterance after a registration burst, pinned a 2G-capped service at 100%
  CPU for 25+ minutes with no further intents matched. `scores()` (called
  on every live utterance) also no longer consolidates at all: it scores
  the already-consolidated store and each pending chunk separately and
  merges the per-label results, since a label's prototypes are always
  fully contained in exactly one of them.

## 0.5.8a2

- Declared template slots fill from live intent context (OVOS-CONTEXT-1
  §7, `ovos-spec-tools` `context_slot_candidates`): a registered template's
  `{slot}` placeholders are recorded at registration time, and any slot with
  a live non-null context entry fills `match_data[slot]` when the utterance
  itself never produces a value for it, independently of any
  `requires_context` declaration on the same intent. m2v never extracts a
  slot value from the utterance (it is a label classifier), so context is
  the only source of a filled value and the OVOS-INTENT-4 per-slot entity
  `.blacklist` remains a no-op here — there is nothing utterance-supplied to
  exclude.

## 0.5.8a1

- Template expansion in every registration path is lazy and bounded:
  `islice(iter_expand(...))` (ovos-spec-tools 1.8.0a1) replaces
  materializing `expand` calls, so a combinatorial template costs what the
  bound takes — registration-time expansion previously materialized full
  cartesian products transiently (~3GB and ~20 minutes measured on a real
  deployment) even though the store then kept at most 2000 samples.

## 0.5.7a1

- Prototype-store growth is amortized: registrations buffer into pending
  chunks and consolidate once on first read (match, save, or property
  access). Previously every registration re-stacked the entire embedding
  array — quadratic build cost, measured as a 1.2GB array reallocated per
  skill on a real install, which is why store construction took tens of
  minutes with one core pegged. Each registration also logs an INFO
  progress line (prototypes added, running totals) so long builds are
  visible instead of looking like an idle hang.

## 0.5.6a1

- The sample bound applies at store ingest, whatever path materialized the
  samples: the 2000-cap previously applied only to entity slot-filling, so
  pre-expanded padatious registrations flowed in unbounded — a real
  deployment still built a ~1.1M-prototype store on 0.5.5a1 and swapped its
  cgroup to death. `PrototypeIntentStore.add` now evenly samples any batch
  over the bound.
- Padatious-contract labels are dealiased: the legacy `.intent`-suffixed
  name folds onto the canonical suffixless label (registration, detach and
  ignore_labels accept both forms), so the dual-emit from ovos-workshop no
  longer stores every prototype twice, and matches dispatch on the same
  canonical id padatious itself uses.

## 0.5.5a1

- Embedding runs strictly in-process: every `model.encode` call passes
  `use_multiprocessing=False`. model2vec otherwise spawns `os.cpu_count()`
  loky worker subprocesses for sentence batches over its threshold, which
  inside a memory-capped service cgroup meant dozens of workers, deep swap
  and an OOM-kill during skill loading on a real deployment. Large template
  batches now encode sequentially — slightly slower for huge batches, never
  a process fan-out.
- Entity-filled template expansion is bounded: the cartesian product over a
  template's registered entity values caps at 2000 combinations, sampled
  deterministically and evenly across the space (endpoints kept). Two
  ~2200-value entities in one template previously materialized ~4.8M
  strings and embedded them all on every registration — tens of GB of swap
  and an OOM-kill on a real deployment.
