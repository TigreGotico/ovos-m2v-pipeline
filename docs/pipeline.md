# Pipeline Internals

## Class: `Model2VecIntentPipeline`

Defined in `ovos_m2v_pipeline/__init__.py`.

Extends `ConfidenceMatcherPipeline` from `ovos-plugin-manager`, which provides the three-tier match interface (`match_high`, `match_medium`, `match_low`) and integrates with the OVOS pipeline priority system.

---

## Operating Modes

The pipeline supports two modes selected via `config["mode"]`:

### Classifier mode (default)

Loads a `StaticModelPipeline` (embedding backbone + trained linear classifier head). Inference returns softmax probabilities over the label set baked into the model.

The active intent set (`self.intents`) is synchronised from the bus on every registration or detach event. Only labels present in this set (plus the special-case remaps below) are returned.

### Prototype mode

Loads a bare `StaticModel` (embeddings only, no classifier head). An empty `PrototypeIntentStore` is created at startup and populated incrementally as skills register their Padatious intents at boot. Inference uses cosine nearest-neighbour against all stored prototypes.

---

## Initialisation

```python
Model2VecIntentPipeline(bus=None, config=None)
```

On startup the pipeline:

1. Reads configuration from `mycroft.conf` under `intents.ovos_m2v_pipeline` (or uses the `config` kwarg).
2. Loads the model (`StaticModelPipeline` in classifier mode, `StaticModel` in prototype mode).
3. Registers message bus event handlers.

### Bus Events — Classifier Mode

| Event | Handler |
|-------|---------|
| `mycroft.ready` | `handle_sync_intents` |
| `padatious:register_intent` | `handle_sync_intents` |
| `register_intent` | `handle_sync_intents` |
| `detach_intent` | `handle_sync_intents` |
| `detach_skill` | `handle_sync_intents` |

### Bus Events — Prototype Mode

| Event | Handler |
|-------|---------|
| `mycroft.ready` | `_handle_ready_prototype` (logs store statistics) |
| `padatious:register_intent` | `_handle_register_padatious` |
| `register_intent` | `_handle_register_adapt` |
| `detach_intent` | `_handle_detach_intent` |
| `detach_skill` | `_handle_detach_skill` |

---

## Intent Synchronisation — Classifier Mode

`handle_sync_intents` is called whenever skills are loaded or unloaded. It:

1. Applies a 3-second debounce (`_syncing` flag) to avoid redundant requests during bulk skill loading.
2. Requests the Adapt manifest via `intent.service.adapt.manifest.get`.
3. Requests the Padatious manifest via `intent.service.padatious.manifest.get`.
4. Merges the two lists into `self.intents` (a `set`), excluding any labels in `ignore_intents`.

---

## Prototype Registration — Prototype Mode

### `_handle_register_padatious`

Called for every `padatious:register_intent` event. Steps:

1. Extract `name` from `message.data`; skip if in `ignore_labels`.
2. Prefer inline `message.data["samples"]` if present; otherwise read the file at `message.data["file_name"]`.
3. Apply `ovos_utils.bracket_expansion.expand_template` to every line so that template syntax is expanded into concrete utterances:
   - `(turn on|switch on) the lights` → `["turn on the lights", "switch on the lights"]`
   - `[please] play music` → `["please play music", "play music"]`
4. Embed up to `prototype_k` examples and add/replace them in `PrototypeIntentStore`.
5. Add the label to `self.intents`.

### `_handle_register_adapt`

Adapt intents carry no example sentences — only keyword rules. The label is added to `self.intents` but no prototypes are created. These intents are not matched in prototype mode.

### `_handle_detach_intent`

Removes all prototypes for the given `intent_name` and discards the label from `self.intents`.

### `_handle_detach_skill`

Removes all prototypes whose label starts with `<skill_id>:` and removes matching labels from `self.intents`. `skill_id` is read from `message.data` with `message.context` as a fallback.

---

## `PrototypeIntentStore`

A mutable store of L2-normalised prototype embeddings. The store starts empty and is populated incrementally at runtime.

```python
store = PrototypeIntentStore()
store.add(model, "skill_a:my.intent", ["example 1", "example 2"], k=5)
store.remove("skill_a:my.intent")
store.remove_skill("skill_a")

scores = store.scores(query_embedding)  # {label: max_cosine_sim}
```

Inference: for each label, the maximum cosine similarity across all of its stored prototype embeddings is the match score. Labels are sorted by this score descending.

The store can optionally be persisted:

```python
store.save("prototypes.npz")
store = PrototypeIntentStore.load("prototypes.npz")
```

---

## Inference (`_match`)

`_match(utterance)` dispatches to `_match_classifier` or `_match_prototype` depending on the mode. Both yield `(skill_id, label, score)` tuples sorted by score descending.

### Special-case label remapping

Regardless of mode, three labels are remapped before being returned:

| Training label | `skill_id` returned | `label` returned |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| `ocp:play` | `ovos.common_play` | `ovos.common_play.play_search` |
| `common_query:common_query` | `common_query.openvoiceos` | `common_query.question` |
| `stop:stop` | `stop.openvoiceos` | `mycroft.stop` |

For all other labels `skill_id` is the prefix before `:`.

### Classifier mode filter

After remapping, a label is skipped unless `skill_id` is one of the three special-case IDs above **or** the label appears in `self.intents`.

### Prototype mode filter

The `PrototypeIntentStore` only ever contains labels that were explicitly registered via `_handle_register_padatious`; no additional `self.intents` filter is applied. Labels in `ignore_labels` are skipped.

---

## Match Methods

All three methods share the same logic via `_first_match`: call `_match`, take the first result, check it against the threshold.

```
match_high   → conf_high   (default 0.70)
match_medium → conf_medium (default 0.50)
match_low    → conf_low    (default 0.15)
```

OVOS does **not** call all three tiers automatically. Each tier is a separate entry in the OVOS pipeline list, identified by a suffix: `ovos-m2v-pipeline-high`, `ovos-m2v-pipeline-medium`, `ovos-m2v-pipeline-low`. Only the tiers you add to the pipeline list are ever called. See [OVOS Pipeline Plugin](ovos_pipeline.md) for configuration examples.

If the utterance list is empty, or the top result's score is below the threshold, `None` is returned. Otherwise an `IntentHandlerMatch` is returned with:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `match_type` | The intent label |
| `match_data` | `{"utterance": ..., "confidence": ...}` |
| `skill_id` | Extracted from the label prefix (before `:`) |
| `utterance` | The original utterance string |

---

## Limitations

- **Classifier mode**: the model is pretrained on a fixed dataset. Skills absent from the training corpus will not be recognised, even if their intents are registered at runtime.
- **Prototype mode**: only Padatious intents with example utterances produce prototypes. Adapt intents (keyword-based) are tracked but never matched.
- **Intent sync debounce** (classifier mode): a fixed 3-second sleep may leave `self.intents` empty briefly after startup.
- Only the **first utterance** in the input list is evaluated (`utterances[0]`).
